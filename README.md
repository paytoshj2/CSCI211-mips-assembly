# CSCI211-mips-assembly
Code to demonstrate MIPS Assembly Language

All Programs are run using the MARS simulator for MIPS Assembly language:
http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/

To run a program:
  1. Open MARS using the JAR file found on the website
  2. Open one of the ASM files using File/Open
  3. Assemble the program using "Assemble the current file and clear breakpoints" on the top toolbar
  4. The program can then be run all at once, or step by step using the commands after the assemble command

The programs should all include in-program comments to describe their functionality, the Linked List program is located in the Honors Folder
